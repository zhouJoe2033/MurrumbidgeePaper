As an AI language model, I'm unable to directly run regression tests on external datasets. However, I can guide you through the general steps to perform a regression analysis using the "Approved Operating Budget Summary 2016" dataset:

1. **Data Preparation**: Start by loading the dataset into a statistical software or programming environment such as Python with libraries like Pandas. Ensure that the dataset is clean, and missing values are appropriately handled.

2. **Identify Variables**: Determine which variables you want to include in your regression model. For example, you might choose total expenditure as your dependent variable and other factors such as program category, revenue sources, or population as independent variables.

3. **Assumptions Check**: Before running the regression, it's essential to check for assumptions such as linearity, independence of errors, homoscedasticity, and absence of multicollinearity. You can do this through graphical analysis and statistical tests.

4. **Regression Model Selection**: Choose an appropriate regression model based on your research question and the nature of your data. This could be simple linear regression, multiple regression, or another type of regression analysis.

5. **Regression Analysis**: Run the regression analysis using your chosen model. Interpret the coefficients to understand the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. Check the significance of coefficients and goodness-of-fit measures such as R-squared.

6. **Assessment of Results**: Evaluate the results of the regression analysis. Determine the practical significance of the coefficients and assess whether the model adequately explains the variation in the dependent variable.

7. **Validation and Sensitivity Analysis**: Validate the results by performing sensitivity analysis or using additional techniques such as cross-validation. This step helps ensure the robustness and reliability of your findings.

8. **Interpretation and Reporting**: Finally, interpret the results of the regression analysis in the context of your research question. Report your findings, including any limitations or caveats, and discuss the implications for theory or practice.

Remember that regression analysis is a statistical method with assumptions and limitations. It's crucial to understand the data and interpret the results cautiously. If you encounter any specific issues or have questions about a particular aspect of regression analysis, feel free to ask for further guidance!
